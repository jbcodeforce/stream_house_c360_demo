"""Pydantic models for the Assistant chat.

The Assistant is a natural-language chat over the C360 data. Step 1 is a stub:
the welcome prompt comes from config (``CHAT_FIRST_PROMPT``) and replies are
canned. ``ChatRequest.history`` carries prior turns so step 2's local agent has
conversation context when it queries ``fct_c360_profile`` via RTCE.
