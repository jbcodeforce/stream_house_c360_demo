"""Pydantic models for the C360 analytics dashboard.

The dashboard reads a single snapshot of ``fct_c360_profile`` and renders it as
KPI tiles plus a handful of single-series distributions. ``DataAnalytics`` is
the whole response: headline totals, averages, a data-quality rollup, and the
category breakdowns the frontend draws as bar charts.
