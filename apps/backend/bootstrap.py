"""Database bootstrap: create schema + CDC publication and seed from CSV.

Defined once and reused by the FastAPI startup lifespan (see ``main.py``) and
by local tooling. Run directly against any PostgreSQL — RDS included — with
``DATABASE_URL`` set:

    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... SINK=postgres python bootstrap.py

Everything here is idempotent: tables use ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS``,
each table adds itself to the CDC publication only if absent, and seeding
runs only when a table is empty.
