# Defining Confluent Cloud Resources with the Consol

## SRE's tasks Walking Through

### Confluent Console Walk Through

We suppose the user has OrganizatonAdmin role to be able to create environment. 

Pre-requisites:

* Login to the Confluent Cloud console

#### Create Confluent Cloud Environment

1. From the home page, go to the environment page, and click on the `Add Cloud Environment` button on the top right part of the page.
1. Enter name and select one of the governance package. As the demonstration scope is not about governance, use Essential

#### Create Confluent Cloud Kafka Cluster

Next step is to create a KafKa Cluster
1. Enter name, and Cluster Type, which for demonstration will be standard.

1. Select a Cloud Provider and a region, select a 99.9% SLA
1. Launch the cluster using the right column 'Launch Cluster button`
1. Create API Key and Secrets

*As part of the essential governance, a schema registry is created once the Kafka Cluster is launched.*

#### Create Confluent Cloud Flink Compute Pool


#### Create Debezium CDC v2 Kafka Connector

Once the database instance is created and has DNS server name and port number and access policies setup, we need to add the Kafka Connector. The figure below illustrates the components created:

1. Define how to access the Kafka cluster. Use an existing API Key ...

    or create a new one

1. Define connection credentials to external database

1. Launch the connector
1. Verify created topics
